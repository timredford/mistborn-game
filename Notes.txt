General thoughts
  I want to make a simple 1 player game. The user will control a hero who has some form of allomantic/ferumetic powers.
  The main goal of this project is to get more experience with OpenGl and programming.
  I am using C because it is the language I am most familiar with right now. (April 18, 2017)
  
Gameplay
  Options
    Side-Scroller(Mario): hero runs around and tries to get to the end without dying, and defeating little monsters.
    RPG(Zelda): player wanders around a map that has many enimies to choose from along with opportunities to build powers and items.
    Arena(Thing Thing Arena): hero trapped in room with enemies and goal is just survival.
    
  Demensions: 
    2D:
      Pro:
        Easier to code up (I anticipate). 
        Less taxing on hardware (Basically means I will not have to worry about making visuals work with timing)
        I can make things look better.
      Con:
        Not as cool looking.
    3D:
      Pro:
        Has the opportunity to look really cool
        Could feel nice (exploring a 3D map is much cooler than 2D)
      Con:
        Could tax the hardware too much.
        Might be very difficult to code up.
        Might not actually look that good (I don't have 3d modeling experience (or a team of artists))

    I'll break it up into different sections.
